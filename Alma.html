      <p>Alma the younger is the son of Alma the elder, who was a Nephite prophet
        who organized the church during the reign of King Noah [1]. In his early
        life, Alma the younger was wicked, oftentimes rebelling against his father
        and seeking to destroy the church, along with King Mosiah&#39;s sons. However,
        after a powerful, yet, life-changing conversion experience, Alma the younger
        converted to the very church he sought to destroy - eventually becoming the
        first chief judge of the Nephites and prophet of the church [2].</p>

      <p>Throughout the book of Alma in the book of Mormon contains stories from
        Alma the younger&#39;s missionary experiences, including the Sermon on the Good
        Shepherd and his missionary work in the city of Ammonihah, his conversion
        story, and his counsels to his sons - all of which teach and/or reveal
        important aspects and doctrines of the gospel [1]</p>

      <h2>Alma The Younger's Conversion</h2>

      <p>In Mosiah chapter 27, it describes Alma the younger(earlier in his life)
        as being a wicked and idolatrous man, despite his father being the complete opposite.
        Alma, along with the sons of Mosiah, sought to destroy the church. They were,
        unfortunately, successful in leading many believers away. One day, an angel
        appeared before Alma and the sons of Mosiah and spoke to them with a loud and
        thunderous voice, warning them of destruction if they continued to seek the
        church&#39;s destruction. Following that warning, Alma the younger collapsed and
        became dumb unable to move his limbs or talk for three days. In verse 11 of
        chapter 36, Alma describes his encounter with the Angel and their warning as a
        feeling of &#147;great fear and amazement&#8221;. His father, Alma the elder, was rejoiced
        to hear of this spiritual encounter, and even invited many to witness what God
        had done for his son.</p>

        <p>They began to pray and fast for the swift recovery of Alma the younger,
          and after two days and two nights, he was normal. Alma the younger had
          repented during the duration in which he was dumb, and from that point
          onward, began teaching the people, trying to fix the damages they&#39;ve caused.</p>

        <p>The conversion story of alma the younger is two fold: it shows the
          impossible action of trying to destroy or hinder the Lord&#39;s work, as
          well as showcasing the power of the atonement in being able to allow
          for the change of heart - no matter how wicked or how far off someone
          is from the straight and narrow path.</p>

        <h2>Nehor</h2>
        <p>Shortly before Alma the Elder and King Mosiah died, Alma the younger
          was appointed to be the first chief judge as well as high priest. However
          it wasn&#39;t long until a man named Nehor was brought before Alma to be judged.
          Nehor preached false doctrine among Alma&#39;s people, whom he became quite popular
          with - even establishing his own church based on his false doctrines. Nehor
          was soon confronted by a man named Gideon, who, as a member of the church,
          reprimanded Nehor for his false teachings. As a result, Nehor smites Gideon
          with a sword, killing him in the process. It was for this very action that
          Nehor was brought before Alma the younger.</p>

          <p>Alma sentences Nehor to death for Nehor&#39;s priestcraft and for Gideon&#39;s
            murder. However, priestcraft and false doctrines continued to spread,
            particularly by those who believed in them. These spreaders of false
            doctrine began to persecute members of the church, and were able to
            get away with it because of loopholes in the law. Many member&#39;s hearts
            were harden and many fell away from the church. Those who stayed
            faithful to the church continued to press forward, despite being
            persecuted. They were also blessed with abundance, and because of
            their faith and generosity, they used those blessings to bless everyone
            in need, despite their personal circumstances.</p>

            <p>As mentioned in Alma 1:12 &#147;this is the first time that priestcraft
              has been introduced among these people&#8221;. While the span of Alma chapter
              1 spans around 5 years, it&#39;s easy to see the dangers and how quickly
              Alma&#39;s people deteriorated into false teachings and doctrines. However,
              as explained in the latter half of alma chapter 1, those who were
              steadfast in the church were blessed, and that they used those
              blessings to bless others, whether or not they were a member of the
              church. This story highlights the importance and blessings that come
              with continued faith and endurance, especially in a time of precedence
              and uncertainty as Alma&#39;s people are experiencing in this chapter.</p>
