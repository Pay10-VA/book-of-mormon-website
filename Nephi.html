      <p>Nephi was one of the more righteous sons of Lehi.  When he was young,
        he and his family left Jerusalem as commanded by the Lord, in order to
        avoid the destruction of its wicked inhabitants. He and his family faced
        numerous faith-testing trials and afflictions as they traveled through
        the wilderness, across the ocean, and eventually into the promised land.
        At the promised land, Nephi became the prophet and leader of his people,
        who are referred to as the Nephites. The accounts of his family&#8217;s journey
        to the promised land are detailed in the first two books of the Book of
        Mormon, and were recorded by Nephi himself upon the small plates of Nephi
        some many years after their journey took place.</p>

    <div class="section" id="journey">
      <h1 class="section-heading">Journey in the Wilderness</h1>
      <p>Nephi and his family left Jerusalem and traveled through the wilderness
        as they journey for the promised land. Throughout their trek, they faced
        many afflictions and contentions that sought to test their faith and
        steadfastness to the Lord. However, it was through these very trials that
        made Nephi the faithful and righteous leader he became.</p>
        <h3>Getting the Plates From Laban</h3>
        <p>One of the first important events in Nephi&#8217;s journey in the wilderness
          is laid out in 1 Nephi chapter 3. Here, the Lord commands Lehi, in a
          dream, to send his sons back to Jerusalem in order to obtain the Brass
          Plates(which contained the record of the Jews and Lehi&#8217;s genealogy, in
          addition to the writing of past prophets.(study helps))  from Laban.</p>

          <div id="laban-section">
              <img src="resources/brass_plates.jpeg" />
              <img src="resources/nephi_laban_house_drunk_lying.jpeg" />
          </div>
          <div id="laban-captions">
            <p>The Brass Plates</p>
            <p>Nephi near Laban&#8217;s House</p>
          </div>
        <p>Getting the plates from Laban wasn&#8217;t that easy. After numerous attempts
          in getting Laban to hand over the plates, Laban refused and robbed and
          threatened to kill Nephi and his brothers. On the verge of giving up,
          Nephi courageously and obediently tries a third time to get the plates.
          Commanded by the Lord, Nephi reluctantly kills Laban with his own sword,
          and uses Laban&#8217;s clothes to disguise himself as he went to get the plates.</p>
        <p>Through his successful seizure of the brass plates, Nephi teaches us
          that the Lord will always gives us the power and guidance we need in
          order to carry out his commandments.</p>
        <h3>Nephi&#8217;s Bow and Arrow</h3>
          <div>
            <div>
              <p>In their journey in the wilderness, Nephi and his family were
                given the Liahona. The church website describes it as a ball with
                two pointers that gave navigational and spiritual instructions in
                the precense of righteousness[lds.org]. In 1 Nephi 16:16, Nephi adds
                on that it aided in their hunting - leading them to the “more fertile
                parts of the wilderness&#34;.</p>
              <p>On one hunting occasion, Nephi&#8217;s bow, which the entire family relied
                on for hunting, broke.  Because of their hardships in obtaining food,
                many people, including Lehi, within Nephi&#8217;s traveling party began to
                murmur and harden their hearts against the Lord. Despite this, Nephi
                continued to have faith and pressed on - even taking it upon himself
                to make a new bow. Those who murmured against the Lord were soon chastened
                by the Lord himself, who explained that the Liahona only worked if one had
                faith and diligence. Because of Nephi&#8217;s newly created bow and continued
                faith and diligence, he was able to find and bring back food for his family.</p>

        <h3>Building the ship</h3>
        <p>After traveling through the wilderness for eight years, they arrive
          in a lush and abundant land, which they called Bountiful. Once settled,
          the Lord commanded Nephi to build a ship that would carry everyone in
          their traveling party across the ocean and to the promised land.
          Although Nephi had no ship building experience, the Lord told Nephi
          that He would guide him through it.</p>
        <p>It wasn&#8217;t long before Nephi&#8217;s brothers, Laman and Lemmuel, began to
          murmur against him: &#34;And thus my brethren did complain against me, and
          were desirous that they might not labor, for they did not believe that
          I could build a ship; neither would they believe that I was instructed
          of the Lord&#34; (1 Nephi 17:18). Nephi rebukes his brothers, questioning
          their disbelief despite everything they&#8217;ve been seen and been through.
          Through the power and instruction of God, Nephi shocks his brothers,
          successfully proving to them the power of God that was with him.</p>
        <p>It&#8217;s sometimes hard to count our blessings in times of hardship. As
          seen in this chapter of 1 Nephi, the same has happened to Laman and
          Lemmuel. In this chapter, Nephi teaches us the power and blessings of
          being obedient to God&#8217;s commandments: &#34;And I will also be your light
          in the wilderness; and I will prepare the way before you, if it so be
          that ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall
          keep my commandments ye shall be led towards the promised land; and ye
          shall know that it is by me that ye are led.&#34;(verse 13)</p>

      <h3>The Vision of the Tree of Life</h3>
        <p>After hearing about Lehi&#8217;s vision of the tree of life, Nephi, because
          of his faith, was able to see it for himself. In this vision, the Spirit
          shows Nephi the Virgin Mary in Nazareth - giving birth to the Savior,
          Jesus Christ. As the vision progresses, he&#8217;s shown Jesus&#8217;s baptism,
          ministries, and miracles.</p>
        <p>In addition, the spirit, whom Nephi encounters, explains the numerous
          metaphors from Lehi&#8217;s vision: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tree of life = represents the love of God, which is the most joyous
             and desirable above all things</li>
          <li>Iron Rod = Represents the word of God, and leads to the tree of
            life</li>
          <li>The Great and Spacious Building - Represents the pride of the world,
            and leads to the destruction of its inhabitants</li>
        </ul>

          <p>And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also having

            bow and an arrow, with a sling and with stones. And I said unto my
            father: Whither shall I go to obtain food? - <strong>1 Nephi 16:23</strong></p>
