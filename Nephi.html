      <p>Nephi was one of the more righteous sons of Lehi.  When he was young,
        he and his family left Jerusalem as commanded by the Lord, in order to
        avoid the destruction of its wicked inhabitants. He and his family faced
        numerous faith-testing trials and afflictions as they traveled through
        the wilderness, across the ocean, and eventually into the promised land.
        At the promised land, Nephi became the prophet and leader of his people,
        who are referred to as the Nephites. The accounts of his family’s journey
        to the promised land are detailed in the first two books of the Book of
        Mormon, and were recorded by Nephi himself upon the small plates of Nephi
        some many years after their journey took place.</p>

      <h1 class="section-heading">Journey in the Wilderness</h1>
      <p>Nephi and his family left Jerusalem and traveled through the wilderness
        as they journey for the promised land. Throughout their trek, they faced
        many afflictions and contentions that sought to test their faith and
        steadfastness to the Lord. However, it was through these very trials that
        made Nephi the faithful and righteous leader he became.</p>
        <h3>Getting the Plates From Laban</h3>
        <p>One of the first important events in Nephi’s journey in the wilderness
          is laid out in 1 Nephi chapter 3. Here, the Lord commands Lehi, in a
          dream, to send his sons back to Jerusalem in order to obtain the Brass
          Plates(which contained the record of the Jews and Lehi’s genealogy, in
          addition to the writing of past prophets.(study helps))  from Laban.</p>

            <p>The Brass Plates</p>
            <p>Nephi near Laban's House</p>
          </div>
        <p>Getting the plates from Laban wasn’t that easy. After numerous attempts
          in getting Laban to hand over the plates, Laban refused and robbed and
          threatened to kill Nephi and his brothers. On the verge of giving up,
          Nephi courageously and obediently tries a third time to get the plates.
          Commanded by the Lord, Nephi reluctantly kills Laban with his own sword,
          and uses Laban’s clothes to disguise himself as he went to get the plates.</p>
        <p>Through his successful seizure of the brass plates, Nephi teaches us
          that the Lord will always gives us the power and guidance we need in
          order to carry out his commandments.</p>

          <p>"I, Nephi, having been aborn of bgoodly cparents, therefore I was dtaught

            in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the
            Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness

          <p>And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also having
            received much astrength of the Lord, therefore I did seize upon the
