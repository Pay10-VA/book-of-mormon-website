      <p>Helaman is the eldest son of Alma the Younger, who was the first chief
        judge and prophet in the Nephite nation. In his youth, Helaman had learned
        of his father&#39;s conversion story and was always strong in his faith and
        in keeping the commandments. Helaman was also commanded, by his father,
        to take charge of his people&#39;s records alongside the plates of the Jaredites,
        which were previously in his father&#39;s possessions. Starting with chapter 45
        in the Book of Alma, Helaman takes over the responsibility of writing on
        the plates, and begins to share the gospel with his people. It is towards
        the latter-end of the book of Alma do we see Helaman in action as he leads
        2000 warriors in a successful military campaign against the Lamanites.

      <h3>Helaman and the 2000 Stripling Warriors</h3>
        <p>The Anti-Nephi-Lehies, or the people of Ammon, were a group of people
          who were converted to the church by the sons of Mosiah. They made an oath
          to never take up weapons of war again, and if they did, they would be
          faced with destruction. As a result, the Nephites took them under their
          wing and provided them with protection, in order for them to keep their
          oath. However, after seeing all that the Nephites have gone through to
          protect the people of Ammon, the people of Ammon began to want to break
          their oath in order to help their Nephi allies out. After having been
          convinced by Helaman to abide by their promise, they figured out that
          some 2000 of their own sons were qualified to fight - as they had not
          made any oath in laying down their weapons of war. These young men
          requested Helaman to be their leader, and as such, Helaman led them
          into battle.</p>

            <p>The 2000 Stripling Warriors [3]</p>
          </div>

          <p>In a letter to Captain Moroni, Helaman explains that he and his army
             were favored by the Lord - which was why they were preserved. In one
             particular battle with whom they fought the Lamanites along with Antipus,
              the Nephites were able to force the Lamanite army to surrender, without
              any of the 2000 warriors dying. Throughout the span of the next couple of
              years, Helaman had led his 2000 warrior strong army through numerous battles,
               which were mostly highlighted in his epistles to Captain Moroni. His small
               army even increased by 60 this time. Despite their small size and lack of
               fighting/war experience, not one soldier from Helaman&#39;s 2060 warrior army
               perished, and it was all because of their faith and because of the
               miraculous power of God.

        <li>
          <p>"And now behold, as they never had hitherto been a disadvantage to
            the Nephites, they became now at this period of time also a great
            support; for they took their weapons of war, and they believed that
            Helaman should be their leader." - <strong>Alma 53:19 [2]</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>"My son, give ear to my words, for I say unto you, even as I said
            unto Helaman, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God
             ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep the
             commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence." - <strong>Alma 38:1 [2]</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>

        <li>
          <p>"Now behold, Helaman and his brethren were no less serviceable unto
            the people than was Moroni; for they did preach the word of God, and
            they did baptize unto repentance all men whosoever would hearken unto
            their words." - <strong>Alma 48:19 [2]</strong></p>
