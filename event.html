      <p>Preceding Christ&#39;s visit to the Nephites in the Americas, the Nephite
        civilization was quite prosperous and industrious. Unfortunately, they
        had also become very prideful, dishonest, and immoral [2]. Prior to the
        Savior&#39;s visitation, the Nephits experienced great storms and earthquakes,
        and darkness that lasted for three days, as was prophesied years prior [1].
        Just how it was prophesied, the Savior visited the Americas where we taught
        the Nephites, ministered, and performed miracles for them.

      <h1 class="section-heading">Jesus Visits the Nephites</h1>
        <p>3 Nephi chapter 11 describes Christ&#39;s visitation to the Nephites in
          the Americas. It starts off with explaining the Nephites' experience
          with hearing God&#39;s voice - where it describes it as being neither harsh
          nor loud, yet, still causing piercing their cores and their hearts to
          burn. God testifies of the Savior, Jesus Christ, whom after, descends
          down to the earth from the Heavens. It must have been such a marvelous
          experience, so marvelous that it made every single person present quiet
          and grabbed their full attention. Because the Savior was dressed in white,
          the Nephites assumed He was an angel. To prove to the Nephites that He
          really was the Savior, Jesus invited them to feel His side, as well as
          the injuries on his hands - the physical marks made as a result of His
          crucifixion on the cross [1].</p>

          <p>During this time, the Savior teaches the Nephites about baptism -
            encouraging all to be baptized in His name. He also gives Nephi and
            the 12 disciples the authority to baptize, as well as instructions
            on how to baptize (the same ones we use to perform baptisms today).
            Jesus instructed His 12 disciples to go about the Nephites to minister,
            serve, and to baptize. Among His many teachings, the Savior taught the
            beatitudes and gave a sermon similar to that of the Sermon on the Mount.
            Additionally, He teaches the Nephites how to pray - to do so in secret,
            to avoid vain repetitions, and to begin the prayer by addressing the
            Father in Heaven. [1] </p>

            <p>After teaching the Nephites, He encourages them to go home to
              think and ponder about the things He&#39;d taught them. Before doing so,
              Jesus healed those who were blind, deaf, leprous, lame, and dumb. He
              also blessed their children individually, and had angels descend from
              Heaven to minister to the Nephites. [1] </p>
